# Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repo contains my notebooks exercises for [Udacity's Deep Learning with PyTorch lesson](https://in.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188).

* **Part 1:** Introduction to PyTorch and using tensors
* **Part 2:** Building fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch
* **Part 3:** How to train a fully-connected network with backpropagation on MNIST
* **Part 4:** Exercise - train a neural network on Fashion-MNIST [Blog Post](https://jcabralc.wordpress.com/2018/12/16/classificando-roupas-com-fashion-mnist-pytorch-scholarship-challenge/)
* **Part 5:** Using a trained network for making predictions and validating networks
* **Part 6:** How to save and load trained models
* **Part 7:** Load image data with torchvision, also data augmentation
* **Part 8:** Use transfer learning to train a state-of-the-art image classifier for dogs and cats
